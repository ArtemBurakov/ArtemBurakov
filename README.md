### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Artem

I am a student from Ukraine and I am currently studying at the Kharkiv National University of Radio Electronics. I am truly passionate about what I do, ready to collaborate with a new team, always open to gain more experience in software development and up for any challenge, no matter how difficult it is.
